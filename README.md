tripartie/tpdk
--------------

Compilation of low-level clients for the most popular languages. Tpdk stands for Tripartie-development-kit.
They are _simples_ wrappers around our OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for:

- Safe-Checkout
- Resolution-Center

Usually you would prefer using a higher level bundle that aim to further reduce friction for integration.

### Support

You may also ask us to add another language or package registry.
